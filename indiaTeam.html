His ability to thrive on crunch situations and bowl with variety caught the eye of the selectors who saw in him a potential to be India’s lead spinner in the future. Though Ashwin started off his career as a top-order batsman for Tamil Nadu, he bagged wickets at will in the domestic circuit. He donned the Indian jersey in 2010 and dumbfounded the best in the business with his skill and variations with the ball. Often known to add something new to his armory and experiment with his bowling, Ashwin later came up with the carrom ball; avariation that was initiated.</p></i></td>

            <h2>ABOUT</h2><br><i>
                Bhuvneshwar Kumar belongs to that breed of bowlers who can swing the ball prodigiously both ways at a decent pace. There has often been the talk of “had he been a few yards faster, he could have been lethal” but that has never been an area of concern for him as he realizes his limitations as a bowler and believes in focussing on his skill set rather than pace. He is often compared to his fellow UP seamer Praveen Kumar who hogged the limelight for swinging the ball considerably beating the best in the business during his hay days. Representing Uttar Pradesh in the domestic circuit, Bhuvneshwar Kumar was known for his smart cricketing brain and being a captain's go-to bowler. His efforts reaped benefits as he made his ODI debut in 2012 against Pakistan.Kumar impressed everyone as he got a wicket in his very first ball of his first over in ODIs sending Mohammad Hafeez back to the pavilion with an outstanding in-swinger. Kumar later ended up with figures of 2/27 in nine overs with an economy of three. Kumar's rise in international cricket has been impressive since then as he got a Test call-up in 2013 against Australia. Still early days in international cricket for the seamer, but Kumar has already shown his tremendous potential with the bat and ball. He does have a first-class century to his name and has shown immense confidence batting lower down the order for India. He was impressive in his first overseas tour to England and even got his name on the Lord's Honours Board picking up a 6-wicket haul in the second Test against England in 2014.

                He was termed as “The Rockstar” by Shane Warne when Ravindra Jadeja took the Indian Premier League by storm in 2008 with his all-round heroics. An eccentric fielder, a more than handy left-arm spinner and a fearless batsman, Jadeja had all the qualities of a utility cricketer. Though predominantly known for his performances for the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, not many notice his efforts in the longer format of the game. The left-handed batsman has three triple centuries to his name with a first-class average close to 50. He paved his way to the national side amassing 739 runs and 42 wickets in the 2008-09 Ranji season. He made his ODI debut in 2009 against Sri Lanka and has been a key player in the Indian since.It took him three more years after his ODI debut to make it into the Test side and India now see him as a good variety in the bowling attack and more than a handy bat lower down the order. International cricket aside, Jadeja has also been a vital cog in the wheel for his IPL franchise - Chennai Super Kings. He was purchased for a whopping sum by the franchise in 2012 and has been one of their marquee players ever since.

            <h2>ABOUT</h2><br><i>
                Behind the earring, the famous twirled moustache and those intricately inked biceps, is a very soft-spoken man – Shikhar Dhawan. From a simple cricket-loving youngster going through the grind of domestic cricket to taking the cricketing world by frenzy by scoring the fastest century on Test debut, Dhawan has come a long way. The road to success has not been easy for the left-handed batsman from Delhi as he toiled his way in the domestic circuit year after year only to receive a Test call-up in his ninth year of first-class cricket. The opening batsman scored in plenty but those only made for good reading for the men in love with numbers. India had a stable opening combination in Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir and Dhawan had to wait for his chance to breakthrough in the big league. When he did get his chance, he grabbed the opportunity with both hands. Such was his dominance in his approach on his Test debut that Dhawan became the talk of the town after treating the Aussie bowlers with utter disdain. He smashed 187 off 174 balls which changed the course of the game completely resulting in India winning the Test comprehensively by six wickets. Following his good run, Dhawan was picked in India's squad for the Champions Trophy. He ended up being the player of the series with 363 runs in five matches at an outstanding average of 90. He hit two centuries in the tournament and was credited for India's success in the tournament. He was also named player of the series and awarded the gold bat for his stellar batting show.

                MS Dhoni called him the ‘find of the tour’ after the bilateral T20I series against Australia that India won 3-0. For long, India had struggled to find a bowler who could be effective in the death overs. Dhoni's long search finally ended when Bumrah answered his calls with his ability to bowl yorkers. While the yorker is his most potent weapon, Bumrah's unorthodox action makes it very difficult for batsmen to read him. If the IPL is all about spotting Indian talent and giving them the platform, the credit for Bumrah's rapid rise must go to Mumbai Indians. It was John Wright, who spotted him in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and drafted him into the squad. Bumrah has shown improvement in every edition and the presence of Lasith Malinga has been an added advantage. The Sri Lankan star has backed his strength and boosted his confidence. The master of yorkers has passed on his experience and the young Bumrah has benefited immensely.
